    <h2>
        What is it?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin" target="_blank">guqin</a> is a Chinese seven-stringed zither, surviving 3000 years of history, clocking as one of China's oldest instruments. Its sounds are produced by plucking the strings, stopping the strings, glissando, and by producing harmonics. There is a range of about four octaves, with the lowest pitch two ocatves below the middle C, and it is a quiet instrument by nature.

    <h2>
        History
    </h2>
    <p>
        The guqin has existed with the Chinese intellectual history as its outlook in Ancient Chinese societies is in combination with those of scholars and noblemen. Traditionally, it is supposed to have five strings representing the five elements that the Chinese believed in, though guqins with as much as ten strings is found in archeological finds. Its rounded surface board is to represent the heavens and its flat bottom board the earth. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_guqin" target="_blank">origin</a> of guqin is more or less a myth, though the legend of the creation of the qin is heavily noted in the books passed down from history.

    <h2>
        Tradition and Modern Usages
    </h2>
    <p>
        Along with the three other art forms of chess, calligraphy, and painting, the guqin is among the four arts of the gentlement in Ancient Chinese society. It is a solo instrument, meant to be played in private for the sake of cultivating the mind or for a small audience. Occasionally, it can also be played by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiao_(flute)" target="_blank">xiao</a>, which is a Chinese vertical flute, or with another guqin in a duet. Though it was quite popular in the elite class of Ancient China, the guqin is still rather out of reach for the general public. The situation for modern Chinese players of the guqin is better, but only a small group of people know how to play this. In recent years, though, many traditional Chinese instruments have started to resurface, mixing in with the pop music produced by the younger generations. It is also quite often used in soundtracks for dramas, movies, or audio dramas taking place in Ancient China.
